alright, so to enter the virtual env,
from the api folder, RUN:
source venv/bin/activate

you can RUN: pip3 list
in order to see the packages available in the venv.

you can also RUN: python3 manage.py runserver
to start the django development server on port 8000.

*NOTE: remember to use 'python3' and 'pip3'
